Hope is the most exciting thing there is in life.
The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Do one thing every day that scares you.
You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal.
Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.
